# Scrimba React Practice
Repo for working through the [React course on Scrimba.](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact)


I'm using the files in this repo to practice the activities (and synthesize new ones) for the tutorial.

I'm using the scrimba-react-practice-tracker.ods to track progress.

Please feel free to clone this repo and use it yourself.
